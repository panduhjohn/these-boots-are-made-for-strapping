# These Boots Are Made For Strapping

### Introduction

Today we'll be building our first little project with Bootstrap's Grid System: a photo album of... boots? Or whatever you want. But the boots are included if you want them.


### Quick Start

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. The bootstrap grid css file is already downloaded. But you'll have to make an index.html file and `link` it! If you want to grab some Bootstrap components, you'll have to download those as well. For this project, no network links, please. Only local css files!
3. Use either the boots provided or download 24 images of another theme.

### Goals

Pay careful attention to the specs here.



* For an "extra large" viewport, there should be 4 rows.
  * The first and last rows should have 8 images.
  * The middle rows should have 4 images each, with the first image in each row taking up half the space.

* For a medium viewport, there should be 6 rows.
  * The odd-numbered rows (1, 3, and 5) should have 4 images each, with the images of even size.
  * The even-numbred rows (2, 4, and 6) should have 3 images each, with the first 2 taking up a quarter of the width and the last taking up half.

* For an extra small viewport, there should be 24 rows of one photo each.


### Guidelines

* You do NOT have to do these viewport sizes in order! I would recommend the extra large and extra small sizes first.
